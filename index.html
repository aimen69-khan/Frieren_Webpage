        <h2>Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</h2>
        <p>Frieren is an elven mage who has lived for over a millennium, experiencing time much differently than her human companions. Centuries ago, her home was destroyed by the Demon King’s forces, leading her to train under the legendary mage Flamme. She eventually joined the Hero Party alongside Himmel, Heiter, and Eisen, completing a ten-year quest to defeat the Demon King and bring peace to the world. For Frieren, those ten years felt like a mere blink of an eye, and it was only after the hero Himmel died of old age fifty years later that she felt a deep, painful regret for not trying to understand him better.

Currently, Frieren is on a new journey toward the northernmost part of the continent to reach Aureole (the "End"), a mythical place where souls are said to reside. Her goal is to speak with Himmel’s soul one last time to give him a proper farewell and express the feelings she didn't recognize while he was alive. As she travels, she has taken on a mentor role for her apprentice Fern and the young warrior Stark, passing down the lessons and values she learned from her old friends. In the future, she plans to continue navigating the dangerous Northern Plateau, overcoming powerful demons and magical obstacles, all while continuing her lifelong passion for collecting seemingly "useless" but interesting spells.
